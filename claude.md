# TCG Coverage Gateway

## Project Overview

This is the TCG Coverage Gateway project - a system designed to manage and track Trading Card Game (TCG) coverage data. The gateway serves as a central point for handling TCG-related information, inventory tracking, or data aggregation.

## Project Context

**Repository**: jonathanrfisher1/TCG_Coverage_Gateway
**Status**: Greenfield project
**Purpose**: Trading Card Game coverage gateway and data management system

## Architecture & Technology Stack

This section will be updated as the project evolves. Expected components may include:

- **Backend**: API gateway for TCG coverage data
- **Database**: Data storage for card information, inventory, or coverage metrics
- **Integration**: Potential connections to TCG data providers or inventory systems
- **API Layer**: RESTful or GraphQL endpoints for data access

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality

- Follow consistent code formatting and style guidelines
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Include unit tests for new functionality
- Document API endpoints and data models
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Git Workflow

- Main development branch: `claude/create-claude-md-015en8KukistvJbu9DePHpde`
- Create feature branches from the main development branch
- Write descriptive commit messages that explain the "why" behind changes
- Keep commits focused and atomic

### Testing

- Write tests for all new features and bug fixes
- Ensure tests pass before committing
- Include integration tests for API endpoints
- Test edge cases and error handling

## Common Tasks

### Starting Development

1. Install dependencies (command TBD based on stack)
2. Set up environment variables
3. Initialize database (if applicable)
4. Run development server

### Running Tests

Commands will be added as the testing framework is established.

### Deployment

Deployment procedures will be documented as the project infrastructure is set up.

## Project Structure

The project structure will be documented here as the codebase develops. Expected directories may include:

- `/src` - Source code
- `/tests` - Test files
- `/docs` - Documentation
- `/config` - Configuration files
- `/api` - API definitions or routes

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

List of required tools and versions will be added as the stack is defined:
- Runtime environment (Node.js, Python, Go, etc.)
- Database system
- Package manager
- Development tools

### Environment Variables

Environment variables required for the project will be documented here.

## API Documentation

API endpoints and their usage will be documented as they are developed.

## Database Schema

Database models and relationships will be documented here as the data layer is implemented.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions will be added as they are encountered during development.

## Contributing

Guidelines for contributing to this project:

1. Follow the established code style
2. Write comprehensive tests
3. Update documentation for new features
4. Review your changes before committing
5. Ensure all tests pass

## Notes for Claude

When working on this project:

- This is a greenfield project - make architectural decisions thoughtfully
- Prioritize clean, maintainable code over quick solutions
- Document design decisions and trade-offs
- Consider scalability and performance from the start
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are ambiguous
- Suggest best practices for the chosen technology stack
- Keep security considerations in mind (API authentication, data validation, etc.)

## Updates Needed

As development progresses, this file should be updated with:

- [ ] Final technology stack details
- [ ] Project structure and directory organization
- [ ] Build and deployment commands
- [ ] API endpoint documentation
- [ ] Database schema and models
- [ ] Environment variables and configuration
- [ ] Testing framework and commands
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline details
